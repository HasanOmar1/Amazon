https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-FURY-Optimized-900x420x4mm-HX-MPFS-XL/dp/B0716ZHGKT/ref=sr_1_3?crid=UYT1IATMMBJ4&keywords=hyperx%2Bmousepad&qid=1694801686&sprefix=hyperx%2Bmousep%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-3&th=1

I have a problem with the search bar , the focus effect is not working on it to show the outline when i click on it [focus].

I tried using hover effect and it worked fine but Amazon's site is not using the hover effect so I didn't apply it.

I also had difficulty making the hamburger menu so I just copied it out of Udemy.

The most difficult thing was creating the navbar , especially the logo since I couldn't find one , so I took a screen shot of it and used it.

I also had difficulty making the website responsive but I think the result is fine.

Other than that it was fine cloning the website.
